When pinging a web address without internet line "icmp_seq=1 Destination Net Unreachable"
When pinging the same web server with connection the line "64 bytes from 1.1.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=225 time=37.6 ms"

it shows you alot of information most of what i do not understand what it means but to me the device
type section looks very interesting it shows operating system information including kernel level info

if portscanned again with apache installed the section that changes is PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 
new http lines are added to the scan it also opens port 80/tcp
