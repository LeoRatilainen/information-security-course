the 7 points of the article are 
1. Tor still works

- From this can conclude that TOR hasn't been broken at a grytographic level
  
2. Tor is not only used by criminals
- loads of people that use tor have no criminal intent in mind
- it's useful for activists who want to circumvent censorship, for the military to use secure communications and Journalists
to communicate with sources securely
- Criminals already have much better tools than what Tor offers such as botnets, stolen devices, identity theft and others.
  
3. Tor does not have a military backdoor
- While the initial development of Tor was funded by the US Navy there has been several audits by cryptographers and security professionals
to confirm no backdoor.
- Tor is open source so anyone can take a look at the code and verify this
  
4.No one in the US has been Prosecuted for running a Tor relay
- Running a Tor relay is not illegal atleast in the US

- There are many easy ways to get Tor and use it with preconfigured secure settings
  
6.Tor is not as slow as you think

than ever before
